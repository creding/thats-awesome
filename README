This app makes it possible to easily setup a local website on your mac. The app takes a domain name of your choice as input then sets up a virtual host on the apache 2 server.

Open the app
enter the domain you want
select the folder for the web files to reside
Click OK

The app then writes the apache config, the host entry ( setting the domain to point to 127.0.0.1) , restarts apache, flushes the DNS cache, writes an index.html file with the domain name to the web directory, and finally opens the site in Safari

thatâ€™s awesome!!!!!!
